# Web Portfolio


## Project Description 
-When creating my web portfolio based on different portfolios that I saw online, this gave me inspiration in designing my web portfolio. 


## Challenges  
-I've  had no difficulty when designing my portfolio, except for the image that used in the resume page. I've tried so many times to habe the image match the media queries, but I eventually figured it out. 

## Lessons Learned
I have learned more about CSS and bootstrap during my time in Web Design 2. I've used what I have learned in my Web Design class for my final assignment.

## Resources
All images and https links in my portfolio are from my own documents and previous assigment, no copyrighted material has been used.
